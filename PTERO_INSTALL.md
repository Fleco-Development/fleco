# Installation with Ptero eggs

## NodeJS Generic

*By @parkervcp*

Change all of these under `Startup / Variables`:

- Git Repo Address = `https://github.com.Fleco-Development/fleco.git`
- Install Branch = `proof_of_concept`
- Auto Update = `true`
- Main File = `index.ts`

The default config file is: `config.yml`

If you would like to change the config path, you can add this to the Additional Arguments variable:

`--config /path/to/config.yml`

Change all of these under `Startup / Variables`:

- Git Repo = `https://github.com.Fleco-Development/fleco.git`
